# InMoov URDF Project

This repository provides a fully functional **Unified Robot Description Format (URDF)** model for the **InMoov** robot platform.

## 📌 Overview

**InMoov** is an open-source, 3D-printed, life-size humanoid robot created by **Gael Langevin**. This project aims to deliver a comprehensive and precise **URDF description** of the InMoov robot for use in **simulation** and **robotics development** environments.

The URDF file was created using **[Blender](https://www.blender.org/)** (version **4.3.2**) with the **[Phobos](https://github.com/dfki-ric/phobos)** add-on.  
Currently, the export uses **STL** files, but you can export in other formats directly from Blender using **Phobos**.

## 🚀 Features

✔️ **Complete URDF model** of the InMoov robot  
✔️ **Accurate joint configurations** and limits  
✔️ **ROS-compatible** (Robot Operating System)  
✔️ **Ready for simulation** in **Gazebo**, **RViz**, and other robotics environments

## 🔍 Help Us Improve the InMoov URDF

We currently include **handsI1** and **headI1**, but we aim to integrate the latest **headI2** and **handsI2** models.

📢 **We need your help!**  
If you have access to **headI2** and **handsI2** Blender files or related resources, please contribute to this open-source effort.

Let's **enhance** the accuracy and usability of the **InMoov simulation** together! 🚀

Feel free to share any leads or files with us.
